        I’m a Software Engineer focused on building efficient, user-centric
        solutions with clean, scalable code. While I enjoy working across the
        stack, I’m especially drawn to backend engineering and app accessibility.
        I believe the best software is software that everyone can use.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Currently, I’m a Junior Software Engineer, contributing to the
        development of full-stack web applications and refining user experiences
        with performance and accessibility in mind.

        In the past, I had the opportunity to develop and maintain web-based ERP
        systems for a range of clients, from startups to large retail companies.
        I also worked directly with clients, collaborating closely to tailor
        solutions that met their business needs.

        Outside of work, I love going on long motorbike trips and exploring new
        places, the road helps me reset and refuel for what’s next.
