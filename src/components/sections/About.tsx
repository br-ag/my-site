          I’m a Software Engineer focused on building efficient, user-centric
          solutions with clean, scalable code. While I enjoy working across the
          stack, I’m especially drawn to backend engineering and app
          accessibility — I believe the best software is software that everyone
          can use.

          Currently, I’m a Junior Software Engineer, contributing to the
          development of full-stack web applications and refining user
          experiences with performance and accessibility in mind.

          In the past, I had the opportunity to develop and maintain web-based
          ERP systems for a range of clients, from startups to large retail
          companies. I also worked directly with clients, collaborating closely
          to tailor solutions that met their business needs.

          Outside of work, I love going on long motorbike trips and exploring
          new places — the road helps me reset and refuel for what’s next.
