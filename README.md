# My Portfolio

A simple frontend project built with **React** and **Vite**, designed for speed, simplicity, and scalability.

### ðŸš¨ TL;DR

This project is my personal attempt to recreate the design of [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com) using React and Vite.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Install the Vite CLI

   ```sh
   npm install -g @vitejs/cli
   ```

2. Install and use the correct version of Node using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

   ```sh
   nvm install
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
